## Description

As part of a code smash for Shopkeep I decided to do something in docker. i am
not that familiar with docker, so going through a few tutorials first before
getting into some (relative) heavy lifting.

This repo is the result of reading the ```quickstart: docker compose and
django``` section from the docs.
